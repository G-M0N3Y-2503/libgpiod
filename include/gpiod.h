/**
 * @mainpage libgpiod public API
 *
 * This is the complete documentation of the public API made available to
 * users of libgpiod.
 *
 * <p>The API is logically split into several parts such as: GPIO chip & line
 * operators, GPIO events handling etc.
 *
 * <p>General note on error handling: all routines exported by libgpiod that
 * can fail, set errno to one of the error values defined in errno.h upon
 * failure. The way of notifying the caller that an error occurred varies
 * between functions, but in general a function that returns an int, returns -1
 * on error, while a function returning a pointer indicates an error condition
 * by returning a NULL pointer. It's not practical to list all possible error
 * codes for every function as they propagate errors from the underlying libc
 * functions.
 *
 * <p>In general libgpiod functions are not NULL-aware and it's expected that
 * users pass valid pointers to objects as arguments. An exception to this rule
 * are the functions that free/close/release resources - which work when passed
 * a NULL-pointer as argument. Other exceptions are documented.
